# Sessions/Talks and Demo Code

Welcome to the repository where I share demo code and presentations from my sessions at different events.
I realize I should have done this earlier, but here it is at least.

## Events and Presentations

Here you'll find code files and other resources organized by event name. Each event directory contains the code files used in the presentation and a `README.md` file with details about the event.

## Repository Structure

```
root
├── EventName1
│   ├── CodeFile1.extension
│   ├── CodeFile2.extension
│   └── README.md
├── EventName2
│   ├── CodeFile1.extension
│   ├── CodeFile2.extension
│   └── README.md
└── README.md
```

Each `EventName` directory contains the relevant sample files and an event-specific `README.md` with additional information about the event.
Some demos could be the same for multiple events depending on the session itself.

I hope you find this useful.
